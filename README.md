Utilities for Tutorial 5: Acoustic Sensors and Signal Processing
===============================================================

This repository contains a small set of helper functions used in the
"Acoustic Sensors and Signal Processing" exercises.  The utilities cover
signal generation, FFT computation, crossâ€‘correlation and basic filter
design.

Tests are provided in ``tests/``.  To run them install the dependencies from
``requirements.txt`` and execute ``pytest``.
