This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks, helper functions, and Python scripts for the FFT, correlation, and filtering exercises.

We first completed the tasks interactively using notebooks (`tutorial5_task2_fft.ipynb`, `tutorial5_task3_correlation.ipynb`, `tutorial5_task4_filtering.ipynb`). Then, we created Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory to quickly reproduce the results. Usage:

```bash
python scripts/task2_fft.py
python scripts/task3_correlation.py
python scripts/task4_filtering.py
```

Plots and audio files are saved in the `results/` directory, clearly named by task (`taskX_Y_<description>`).

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
